# 🚀 ARUN Bot: Founder's Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the ARUN Trading Bot. This project is built for professional, algorithm-assisted trading with a focus on **Safety** and **User Empowerment**.

## 🛠️ How to Get Started (In 3 Minutes)

Since you are not a developer, follow these exact steps to start testing the latest fixes on your machine:

### 1. Extract the Latest Work

**Option A: Visual Method (Inside Antigravity)**
1.  Open your **Antigravity Workspace**.
2.  Click the **Git/Source Control** icon (usually on the left sidebar).
3.  Click the **Pull** button (or the `...` menu and then **Pull**) to download the latest updates.

**Option B: Manual Method (Command Prompt)**
1.  Open the folder containing the bot in Windows.
2.  Click on the **Address Bar** at the top of the window (where it shows the folder path).
3.  Type `cmd` and press **Enter**. A black command window will open.
4.  Type `git pull` and press **Enter**.
5.  Wait for it to finish, then close the black window.

### 2. Launch the Application
1.  Find the file named `LAUNCH_ARUN.bat` in the main folder.
2.  **Double-click** it.
3.  The **Titan V2 Dashboard** (in Dark Neon) will appear.

### 3. Verify the Fixes (Stability Check)
-   **Dashboard Health**: Look at the balance in the top right. It should reflect your `mStock` balance.
-   **Settings Test**: Go to the **Settings** tab. Try changing the "Stop Loss" slider and click **Save Configuration**. It should now save smoothly without errors.
-   **Butler Mode**: Go to the **Hybrid** tab. You will see your manual stocks listed. Try toggling "Butler Mode" to see how the engine prepares to monitor them.
