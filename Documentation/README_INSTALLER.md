# 🚀 Installing ARUN Trading Bot

## The "One-Click" Way (Recommended)

1.  **Download** the project folder.
2.  Double-click on **`START_HERE.bat`**.
3.  **Wait**. The installer will:
    *   Check if you have Python (and install it if needed).
    *   Set up the bot's environment.
    *   Create a **LAUNCH_ARUN** shortcut right in this folder.
    *   Launch the Setup Wizard.

### Advanced Options

**Quick Start Mode** (Auto-launch after install):
```
START_HERE.bat --quick
```
This will install everything and automatically launch the bot without waiting for you to click.

**Installation Logging**:
All installation steps are automatically logged to `install.log` in the project folder. If something goes wrong, check this file for details.

## Troubleshooting

### "Windows protected your PC"
This is normal for new apps.
1.  Click **More info**.
2.  Click **Run anyway**.

### "System Offline"
Make sure you are connected to the internet. The bot needs to fetch market data.
