## 🛠 Recent Engineering Improvements
*   **Stability & Accuracy Update (v2.5.0)**:
    *   **RMS Cooldown**: Automated 1-hour cooldown for "Insufficient Quantity" rejections to prevent infinite SELl loops.
    *   **Immediate Panic Stop**: Refactored `run_cycle` with mid-loop checks for `STOP_REQUESTED`, ensuring immediate response to user stop commands.
    *   **Real-time Trade Counters**: Unified "SUCCESS" and "FAILED" counters on the dashboard using `StateManager` data for broker-level execution accuracy.
    *   **P&L Logging Robustness**: Added fallback entry price support in `trades_db.py` to ensure P&L is calculated even if the initial BUY record is missing.
*   **Risk UI Modernization (v2.4.2)**: Redesigned Settings > Risk Controls with grouped cards, visual sliders, and improved safety toggles. Added `COLOR_DANGER` constants.
*   **Duplicate Buy Fix (v2.4.2)**: Made `check_existing_orders` symbol-aware across all exchanges. Prevents buying `ABC` on NSE if `ABC` is already held/ordered on BSE.
*   **Config Self-Healing (v2.4.2)**: Fixed corrupted `settings.json` where strategies were stuck as `NaN`, defaulting them to `TRADE`.
*   **REIT OHLC Fix (v2.3.1)**: Fixed REIT OHLC API 400 errors. Numeric token mapping (`NSE:9383`) was wrong - OHLC API expects scrip names. Now tries BSE exchange first for REITs (where they're listed as regular equity), eliminating log spam.
*   **Scanner Key Case Fix (v2.3.1)**: Fixed `scanner_complete()` using lowercase `r['signal']` vs scanner engine's uppercase `r['SIGNAL']`, which prevented STRONG BUY/BUY summary counts from displaying.
*   **REIT Mapping & Fallback**: Resolved mStock OHLC API errors for `EMBASSY` and `BIRET` by implementing scrip token mapping and a holdings-based price fallback.
*   **Balance Accuracy**: Fixed "Used" capital inflation by strictly summing only `BOT` tagged positions and correctly tagging manual holdings as `BUTLER`.
*   **Connectivity Hardening**: Standardized browser-like headers and refined offline detection to prevent engine pauses during transient API issues.
*   **Hot-Reloading**: Settings can now be saved and applied without restarting the entire bot.
*   **Professional Installer**: Surfshark-style EXE installer for one-click setup on new machines.
